    <p class = "realBio">Kode With Klossy Alumni, Creator of PSEUDO, Incoming Georgia Tech Student, & Co-Founder of S(HE)TEM</p>

    <p class = "questText">What are you studying/excited for at Georgia Tech and why?</p>
    <p class = "answerText">I’m studying Computational Media at Georgia Tech, which is basically a mixed degree in Computer Science and Design. It also allows you to be part of two colleges on campus. The first being the College of Computing, which includes Computer Science. The other one being the School of Literature, Media, and Communications, which includes liberal arts and design aspects! I’m excited to explore different parts of Atlanta. I want to visit the CNN Center, Olympic Park, and Google and Chick-Fil-A Headquarters! I also already started talking to some people from Arizona, Florida, and more. With this, it reminds me of a Private University since not many people are actually from Georgia. I really want to learn and explore more about my passions and I think GT is a great place to do that!</p>

    <p class = "questText">Who’s your STEM female role model and why?</p>
    <p class = "answerText">My STEM female role model would have to be Hedy Lamarr, because she literally invented WiFi! At a young age, I was really interested in her and even did a “famous figures” project on her in 5th Grade. I also love how at the same time that she was an inventor, she was also an actress.</p>

    <p class = "questText">What’s your dream job and why?</p>
    <p class = "answerText">My dream job would be to be a UX Designer or Software Engineer! I really would like to work in an environment that’s fresh and creative and has a lot of team building projects. I would rather not work in a bland office because I feel like my creativity would not be able to shine through since I am in a place that I dislike.</p>

    <p class = "questText">Do you have any advice for young girls who want to start coding clubs, similar to your own, at their schools?</p>
    <p class = "answerText">I would say just go for it! You won’t know the outcome until you try! It also allows you to create a safe and creative safe where you can express your passions for coding with other girls. You could also try entering coding competitions. I remember my club and I did this program called Girls Go CyberStart, where we solved a bunch of puzzles about coding. It was able to teach us the basics of HTML and Python! Not only this, but some of us got $500 scholarships for completing a high amount of puzzles!</p>
