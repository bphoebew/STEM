  <p class = "realBio">Computer Science student at the University of Michigan, Microsoft Intern, Researcher in the Crowds + Machines (CROMA) Lab</p>
  <p class = "questText">What got you interested in computer science?</p>
  <p class = "answerText">After I saw the announcement about Karlie Kloss' launch of Kode With Klossy, I was inspired by how passionate she was about teaching girls to code. That same day I started some free online tutorials and loved the logic and creativity involved in coding. After that, I enrolled in some classes at my high school and fell in love with how computer science can be applied to other areas you are passionate about. Now I am studying computer science in college and am loving it!</p>
  <p class = "questText">What was your favorite part about interning for Microsoft? How did you get that internship?</p>
  <p class = "answerText">My favorite part about interning at Microsoft was having the opportunity to pursue my passions. While there, I reached out to many full-time employees who were working in areas I am interested in such as accessibility. They were all very encouraging and even worked with me on a side project so that I could learn more about the field. It was an incredible experience!
<br><br>
I became aware of the Explore Program (a Freshman/Sophomore internship) at an event on campus. After that event, I was inspired to apply because of how much Microsoft cares about the people and companies their technology serves. After applying, I completed two rounds of interviews and was offered the position!

  <p class = "questText">Do you have any advice for young girls who are interested in becoming software engineers?</p>
  <p class = "answerText">My advice is to go for it! Sometimes software engineering can be difficult, but if you stick with it, I promise you can succeed and thrive. Find ways to intersect computer science with other passions such as gaming, healthcare, art, and or music. We need you in computer science!
</p>
  <p class = "questText">What’s the coolest thing you’ve programmed?</p>
  <p class = "answerText">My favorite project I've worked on was a desktop experience for Microsoft called Hummingbird. When my Explore Pod (myself and two other women) started, there was already a Hummingbird mobile app, but we were tasked with designing and creating the desktop version. I worked with React, TypeScript, and CSS and loved seeing our ideas come to life.</p>
