  <p class = "questText">What got you interested in your chosen STEM field? / What got you interested in coding?</p>
  <p class = "answerText">- I took an Intro to Programming class in 10th grade at my school. I enjoyed the problem-solving aspect of the class and the logical manner in which everything was done.</p>
  <p class = "questText">How did you learn to code?</p>
  <p class = "answerText">- I learned to code through the computer science classes offered at my school, as well as through summer programs. The summer before my junior year, I attended the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program the summer before my junior year and Kode With Klossy the summer before my senior year.</p>
  <p class = "questText">Do you have any advice for young girls who are interested in entering your field?</p>
  <p class = "answerText">- I think it’s really important for girls to have exposure to the fields that they’re interested in. There are so many free resources that they should apply to, such as Girls Who Code and Kode With Klossy. There are also many online courses, such as Code Academy and Free Code Camp, that are very accessible and informative.</p>
