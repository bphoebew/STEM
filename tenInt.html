  <p class = "realBio">Kode With Klossy Alumni, Published Researcher, Incoming Caltech Student, & Co-Founder of S(HE)TEM</p>
  <p class = "questText">What are you studying/excited for at Caltech and why?</p>
  <p class = "answerText">I will be studying Computational and Neural Systems! I chose this major because it perfectly combines two of my passions, neuroscience and computer science, and will prepare me well for a career in research or industry. I chose Caltech because not only is it an amazing school for STEM, but it also has an unparalleled tight-knit, collaborative community. I’m so excited to be a part of Caltech’s house system; it’s a lot like Hogwarts! I also can’t wait to take part in research, be taught by Nobel Laureates, and take my take-home exams (yup Caltech trusts their students enough to let them take tests in the comfort of their dorm rooms!). Oh, and I can’t wait to pull some pranks on our rival MIT ;)</p>

  <p class = "questText">Will you continue to learn and expand your knowledge at CalTech?</p>
  <p class = "answerText">Whether it be through scientific research or through collaboration with my peers on problem sets, I know I will learn something new everyday at Caltech! In addition to neuroscience and computer science, I hope to learn more about theoretical math and astronomy.</p>

  <p class = "questText">Who’s your STEM female role model and why?</p>
  <p class = "answerText">I have too many STEM female role models to count, but I’m currently most inspired by two of them. Heather Bresch, the CEO of Mylan, is the first woman to run a Fortune 500 pharmaceutical company and was named one of Fortune’s "50 Most Powerful Women In Business.” I aspire to be a force to be reckoned with in the STEM industry like her in the future. Also, I recently rewatched Hidden Figures which reminded me what an icon Katherine Johnson was (we have a biography about her under our history tab by the way!). She graduated high school at 14, co-authored 26 scientific papers, and was one of the first African American women to work as a NASA scientist; I aspire to be half as amazing as her. </p>

  <p class = "questText">Where do you see yourself in 5 years?</p>
  <p class = "answerText">Hopefully, I’ll be attending graduate school (Stanford please accept me four years from now) or working for a tech/biotech company in California. </p>
