  <p class = "realBio">Structural Engineer, Founder of Building Stories Podcast, Management Today 35 Women Under 35</p>
  <p class = "questText">Do you have any advice for young girls who want to pursue a career in structural engineering?</p>
  <p class = "answerText">Even though only 17% of structural engineers are women, do not let this discourage you. See this as a challenge; one that you can easily triumph over. Structural engineering is such a fun job because it allows you to not only be analytical but also creative. You get to design everything from bridges to buildings, so I strongly encourage all young girls to consider pursuing structural engineering!</p>
  <p class = "questText">Why did you start your podcast, Building Stories?</p>
  <p class = "answerText">I started Building Stories because I wanted people to know more about the fascinating hidden stories behind every structure. In my podcast, I interview many engineering experts and take listeners on a journey through their projects -- from the materials they used to the final design. <a href = "https://www.buildingstoriespodcast.com/" target = "_blank">Check it out here: www.buildingstoriespodcast.com/</a></p>
  <p class = "questText">What does a normal day working as a structural engineer look like for you?</p>
  <p class = "answerText">Right now, I am on maternity leave, but there really is no “normal day” for me. Some days I review structural shop drawings for projects; other days I build and refine structural models. But I also spend a lot of time computing the calculations needed to come up with these structures.</p>
  <p class = "questText">What was the most challenging engineering project you've worked on, and how did you overcome the difficulties it presented?</p>
  <p class = "answerText">The most challenging project that I worked on was The Shard, the tallest building in Western Europe, which I spent six years on. I was able to overcome many of the difficulties I encountered with the help of my wonderful, supportive team. We would always brainstorm solutions together and divide up the work, so no one would feel overwhelmed. I would persevere through every challenge The Shard presented to me, knowing the fact that my hard-work would pay off in the end. And it did -- I was incredibly honored to be the only woman featured in Channel 4's documentary on the Shard.</p>
