  <p class = "realBio">is a sophomore studying Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. She was a teacher assistant for Kode With Klossy LA 2019.</p>
  <p class = "questText">What got you interested in your chosen STEM field? / What got you interested in coding?</p>
  <p class = "answerText">I became interested in computer science after taking AP Computer Science, a programming course that my high school offered. I really enjoyed the course because it requires a lot of problem solving, and it challenged me in ways that no other subject had.</p>
  <p class = "questText">How did you learn to code?</p>
  <p class = "answerText">I learned to code through my high school’s AP Computer Science classes, as well as through a program called Kode With Klossy. Both taught me so much about back-end programming and front-end web development and I still enjoy doing both to this day.</p>
  <p class = "questText">Do you have any advice for young girls who are interested in entering your field?</p>
  <p class = "answerText">I would advise young girls to not be discouraged by the gender gap in STEM/computer science, but rather see it as a challenge that it’s their mission to overcome. I would also encourage young girls to join programs such as Kode With Klossy or Girls Who Code where they can learn among other girls as I did to gain more confidence in a comfortable environment.</p>
