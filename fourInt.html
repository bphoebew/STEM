  <p class = "realBio">is the Founder of FIIT (Females in IT) Collective, Host of Females in Tech Show</p>
  <p class = "questText">Why did you start your business, FIIT Collective?</p>
  <p class = "answerText">It took me a whirlwind of a career journey to finally land my dream job in tech. During primary school I was awarded with a High Distinction in Computing, however was never presented with the opportunity to study or pursue a career path in tech. I went on to study Business Management and Accounting at University and during this time worked as a Tax Account. After 3 years working in accounting I realised it wasn't the right career path for me. This lead me to starting up a division in recruitment firm that specialised in Salesforce recruitment. I fell in love with the product, and found myself spending more time learning the product then actually recruiting, After a year in recruitment I finally made the jump into the tech industry, and now work directly for Salesforce in their services team.
<br><br>
After finally landing my dream job in technology, I often wondered if I was presented with the option to undertake a Bachelors in Computer Science if I would be more advanced in my career today. It took me three different career paths, and a Bachelors of Business and Accounting before I realised my true purpose was in information technology.
<br><br>
I have learned that only 12% of software engineers are female, even though women represent 47% of the workforce. I have also discovered a lot of women in tech did not study computer science but came into it later on.
<br><br>
During my first year in tech (and working with predominantly males) I found myself constantly searching for inspirational online for suitable support networks, and to find career stories of females in technology.
<br><br>
I was surprised I was unable to find anything dedicated to females, or that inspired me to continue with my career in tech. There was nothing.
<br><br>
And so FIIT Collective was born. A platform dedicated to providing women in technology with the inspiration and practical resources to achieve a more purposeful career and life.</p>
<p class = "questText">Why did you choose to pursue a career in IT (information technology)?</p>
<p class = "answerText">I truly believe that I didn't choose to pursue a career path in tech. It chose me... I excelled in computing in primary school, and although was not presented opportunities during highschool or university, I fell back into my true roots years later.
<br><br>
In saying this... tech is the future. In Australia 100,000 new information technology (IT) roles will be created by 2024. Majority of individuals globally will be working in a tech related role in years to come. This doesn't mean you have to be a coder to work in tech, there is so many tech roles out there including tech law, marketing, HR and accounting.
<br><br>
 It is the future and I am very grateful to have entered this industry early in my career path..</p>
 <p class = "questText">Whoâ€™s your female role model and why?</p>
 <p class = "answerText">Emma Issacs - she is the founder and Global CEO of Business Chicks, Australia's largest community for women, and is passionate about encouraging women to be bold, to be courageous and to take risks.
<br><br>
I love everything about her... her ability to manage work and life, her passion in helping women, her authenticity, leadership, charisma and business skills. </p>
<p class = "questText">Do you have any advice for young girls who want to pursue a career in a male-dominated field?</p>
<p class = "answerText">Follow your passion, if that's in tech then go for it!
<br><br>
Once you get into the industry find some external women groups, to connect with and get the support you need.
<br><br>
Just because an industry is male-domainated, doesn't mean women aren't welcome. Men are part of the picture in shifting society into a more equal and diverse workplace.
<br><br>
Regardless of the industry we are still in a society where women (and men) will face some form of discrimination. And I am not just talking about gender... discrimination comes in many forms such as age, race, sexual orientation and disability.
<br><br>
This discrimination is easier to over come when you follow your passion.
<br><br>
When you're passionate, whatever challenge falls on your path, as hard as it might be at the time, you know you're strong enough to get through it. </p>
