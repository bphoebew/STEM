  <p class = "realBio">Software Engineer, Studying Computer Science at Cornell Tech, Mentor @ openclassrooms</p>
  <p class = "questText">What made you interested in becoming a software engineer?</p>
  <p class = "answerText">I was always interested in building cool things with technology. The ability to create things that millions of people can access just from sitting in front of a computer feels like a superpower that everyone can learn how to do!</p>
  <p class = "questText">Can you describe some projects that you have done as a software engineer?</p>
  <p class = "answerText">Something I'm proud of is a web app I'm currently working on called Constitute, where you can view a live feed of sexist or discriminatory tweets against female politicians. I built it with two good engineering friends of mine using Django, Postgres, and React.js. A cool project I've done recently is work on a machine learning image retrieval tool using natural language descriptions. I'm also currently working on a sexual health and wellness startup called Ash that I'm really excited about! (Check us out on instagram at @try_ash)
  </p>
  <p class = "questText">What is it like studying Computer Science at Cornell Tech?</p>
  <p class = "answerText"> Studying Computer Science at Cornell Tech is really exciting and challenging. I'm learning really important topics like Applied Machine Learning, Advanced Algorithms and Data Structures, Security and Privacy, and Technical Leadership. It's one of the hardest things I've ever had to do in terms of the amount of time and effort needed to understand and get all the work done. It's also one of the most rewarding things I've done and I'm really proud of what I've achieved.</p>
  <p class = "questText">Do you have any advice for young girls (more specifically those in the LGBTQ community) who want to pursue a career in a male-dominated field?</p>
  <p class = "answerText">Find as many allies as possible - whether they are female, LGBTQ, or otherwise. There are people who support and cherish you for exactly who you are. Surround yourself with and draw strength from those people. Remember that you deserve to be where you are just as much as everyone else and you can and should take up the space you need. </p>
