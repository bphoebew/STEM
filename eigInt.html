  <p class = "realBio">Founder/Creator of ReDawn, Kode With Klossy Instructor, Former Apple Intern, Named one of Huffington Post’s 10 Girlboss Women in Tech</p>
  <p class = "questText">What got you interested in computer science?</p>
  <p class = "answerText">When I was 15, I didn’t really know what coding was. I’ve always been intrigued by what made the world turn and, naturally, have been drawn towards maths and science. Although, the technology behind everything from the apps on my phone to the websites I visit regularly seemed like too complex of a concept for me to grasp. I had thought, “if this isn’t a subject isn’t taught in school, it must be too complicated for me to understand”. Around the same time, I had found a PRGM button on my graphing calculator which, I had assumed, was for making minimal computer programs. After a bit of tinkering following a statistics exam, I was able to make a fully functional program that would “sing” Hello by Adele. I was pleasantly surprised that with a few simple functions and sheer curiosity, I was able to make something out of absolutely nothing. I couldn’t help but wonder what possible on a full computer if I began with a program on a calculator.</p>
  <p class = "questText">How did you learn to code?</p>
  <p class = "answerText">I stumbled upon Kode with Klossy (a scholarship program that teaches girls aged 13-18 how to code in fun + collaborative classrooms), and, armed with my graphing calculator in one hand and my unquenched thirst for knowledge in the other, I applied to their 2016 summer program in Downtown Los Angeles. Luckily, I was accepted and began an incredible journey into learning all there is to know about code and banding together with my fellow scholars to obliterate the glass ceiling that’s limiting so many girls from venturing into tech. As none of my STEM classes until this program were entirely young women, it was refreshing to be in an environment in which we could bond both over stereotypical girl things and plans for world domination. All toxic masculinity, which many of us had experienced throughout schooling one time or another, was left at the door, as we were filled with empowerment. Programs like Kode with Klossy are so important for girls because, while the typical tech workplace doesn’t excel in equal representation, there’s comfort in knowing that I have a sisterhood of like-minded, brilliant, and spunky young women who would always support my ventures.

  <p class = "questText">What inspired you to create your app ReDawn?</p>
  <p class = "answerText"> September 16th, 2018, one of my closest friends was drugged and assaulted. I desperately wanted to help in any way that I could, but all I had ever been taught were “preventative” measures: “Don’t wear this, don’t act like that, learn how to fight, and NEVER walk alone at night.” It’s as if these precautionary tales were like verses of a poem we had to internalize and live by. Unfortunately for us, these tales ended at prevention and left us in the dark following such a harrowing incident, where a light at the end of the tunnel would have made all the difference. <br><br> We resorted to vigorously googling everything we could in hopes of finding next steps. At this point, I couldn’t imagine what my friend was going through considering how painful and confusing the process had been and, a bit selfishly, I had no clue what I would do if something similar happened to me. Almost exactly 3 weeks later, Brett Kavanaugh was confirmed to the Supreme Court. I quickly came to the realization that the system as it stood was stacked against us. Overwhelmed with rage, fear, and confusion, I couldn’t wrap my mind around how the road for abusers was paved with yellow bricks, while the road for survivors was barren, and unpaved. I felt that it was more important now than ever to have something that would give survivors, their communities, and anyone with a yearn to learn a resource that would hopefully prevent things like this from happening again.</p>
  <p class = "questText">What’s the coolest/most challenging thing you’ve coded?</p>
  <p class = "answerText">During my second year of Kode With Klossy, we were able to learn Javascript and p5, which make for aesthetically pleasing front end, and my personal favorite skill to date: A-frame (aka VR programming). I was able to make a VR Solar System in which all the planets revolve around you and it was the most satisfying thing I’ve coded in my entire life. Difficult, because making the model mathematically sound involved a lot of computation and tweaking, but SO cool to see my work come to life through such an up and coming medium.</p>
  <p class = "questText">Do you have any advice for young girls who are interested in computer science?</p>
  <p class = "answerText">Learning to code is such an invaluable skill to have, as it has cross-sections in every industry. While many see coding as a science, code is very much a medium for expression and creativity, it is simply a new way we can all have our voices heard and share the issues that matter to each of us. Everyone has different ideas, different stories, different lifestyles, and computer science allows us to customize and create fixes to problems faced by ourselves or by others. Solutions to ailments that either impact a handful of people or the planet as a whole, lie within code, and you will only begin to unlock your limitless potential once you type “Hello, World” for the first time. </p>
